Python driver for Sahi (http://sahi.co.in/).

Sahi is a web automation tool. Sahi runs as a proxy, and the browser needs to
be configured to use Sahi's proxy. The browser can then be driven via the Sahi
Python driver.

This work was based on the Ruby driver for Sahi.

I am not affiliated with Sahi or Tyto Software and this work was completed
independently.
