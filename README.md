# Python driver for Sahi (http://sahi.co.in/)

Sahi is a web automation tool. Sahi runs as a proxy, and the browser needs to
be configured to use Sahi's proxy. The browser can then be driven via the Sahi
Python driver.

I am not affiliated with Sahi or Tyto Software and this work was completed
independently.

Requires Python 3 or above

# Maintenance

I originally wrote this library as an exercise to gain a better understanding of
the Sahi API. It was based on the Ruby driver for Sahi. I am no longer writing
automated tests using Sahi and will not be maintaining this library. However, I
have left the repository in case anyone would like to fork or use the code for
reference.
